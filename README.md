# Number Guessing Game

This Python program lets you play a number guessing game against the computer. You can choose whether you want to guess the computer's number or have the computer guess your number.

## Features

* **Two Game Modes:**
    * **User Guessing Mode:** You try to guess a random number generated by the computer.
    * **Computer Guessing Mode:** The computer tries to guess a number you choose. It uses a binary search algorithm for efficient guessing.
* **Input Validation:** The program handles invalid user input, such as non-numeric guesses or incorrect feedback in the computer guessing mode.
* **Clear Feedback:** The program provides clear feedback, telling you if your guess is too high or too low, or if the computer's guess is too high or too low.

## How to Play

1.  **Run the Script:** Execute the Python script (e.g., `guessing_game.py`) from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python guessing_game.py
    ```
2.  **Choose a Game Mode:**
    * You will be prompted to choose whether you want to guess the number or have the computer guess.
    * Enter 'u' to guess the number.
    * Enter 'c' to have the computer guess your number.
3.  **Play the Game:**
    * **If you choose to guess:** The computer will think of a number, and you will try to guess it. The program will tell you if your guess is too high or too low.
    * **If you choose to have the computer guess:** You will think of a number, and the computer will try to guess it. You will need to provide feedback ('h' for too high, 'l' for too low, 'c' for correct) to help the computer.
4.  **Win the Game:** The game ends when the number is guessed correctly.

## Code Description

The code consists of the following functions:

* `user_guess(max_number)`: This function implements the game where the user tries to guess the computer's number.
    * It takes the highest possible number as input.
    * It generates a random number within the specified range.
    * It prompts the user to guess the number.
    * It provides feedback to the user (too high, too low, or correct).
    * It continues until the user guesses the correct number.
* `computer_guess(max_number)`: This function implements the game where the computer tries to guess the user's number.
    * It takes the highest possible number as input.
    * It uses a binary search approach to guess the number efficiently.
    * It prompts the user for feedback (too high, too low, or correct).
    * It continues until the computer guesses the correct number.

The main part of the script:

* Prompts the user to choose between the two game modes.
* Calls the appropriate function based on the user's choice.
* Includes a loop to allow the user to play again.

## Running the Code

1.  Make sure you have Python installed.
2.  Save the code to a file named `guessing_game.py` (or any name you prefer).
3.  Open a terminal or command prompt.
4.  Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
5.  Run the script using the command `python guessing_game.py`.
